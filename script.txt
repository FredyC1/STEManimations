The S A T is in two weeks and if you dont know these 4 math topics you're cooked. 
Time is running out so lets lock in. Topic one is slope intercept form, the S A T loves
throwing them at you, the equation is this where m is slope and b is the y intercept You
can find the slope with this equation, mess this up and your done. Next is the quadratic 
formula if you see a x squared plus b x squared plus c equals zero use this formula, dont 
forget its plus or minus not just plus. Number three is functions and f of x notation if they
give you f of c equals five x plus four and ask for f of three just plug in three for x. 
The last topic is exponent rules remember multiplying means you add exponents together 
dividing means subtracting exponents, power to a power means multiply exponents If you 
see a negative exponent then flip it. Lock in for the S A T and make sure to follow.
